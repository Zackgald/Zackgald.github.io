## Zack Gald Individual Website

Welcome to our project report for the "String Machine" developed for EGR314. This website will provide an overview of our team's design process, ideation, and the technical details behind the String Machine project.

My name is Zack Gald, and I am responsible for the stepper motor component of the design. The goal of this project is to create a machine with motor-controlled strings that can produce different tones from human pitches. Through collaboration and iteration, our team has worked to develop an innovative solution, and this site will walk you through our journey, from concept generation to the final design.
